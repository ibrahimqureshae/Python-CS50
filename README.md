# CS50 Python

Solving the Problem Sets of [CS50’s Introduction to Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/) — One at a Time:  

## Course detail
It deals with 
Functions, Variables,
Conditionals,
Loops,
Exceptions,
Libraries,
Unit Tests,
File I/O,
Regular Expressions,
Object-Oriented Programming,
Et Cetera.

## Disclaimer
I have to give the disclaimer, I do provide full solutions here, but if you are here trying to find the code block that will help you pass the tests without thinking, you are wasting your time, and that is sad. It is a much stronger learning experience when it is you who searches, thinks and finds the solution. I am here to talk about the problem sets and to be a helpful guide for different approaches along the way.

## Problem Sets
* Problem Set 1
  * [Deep Thought](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/1/)
